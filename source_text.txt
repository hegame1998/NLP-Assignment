Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. Most NLP techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human languages. Applications of NLP include speech recognition, text summarization, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more. The field of NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data, and to 'understand' its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.
